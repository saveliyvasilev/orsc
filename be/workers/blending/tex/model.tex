Hi there! asd

To add the hard bounds for the assay once would initially think of
$$
\frac{\sum_{p, o} load_{p, o} * asy_{p}}{total_load_o} \leq asy_ub
$$

Which would work well if $total_load_o$ is a constant, but it might not be since we allow for underload.

One way is to rewrite the expression with the underload considered, and leaving the constraint as a linear one:

$$
\frac{\sum_{p, o} load_{p, o} * asy_{p}}{demand_o} \leq asy_ub * (demand_o - underload_o)
$$
