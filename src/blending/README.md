# Blending demo

Blending products (bulk materials or oils) is a typically encountered procedure in industry.

The goal is to maximize profitability while fulfilling the required customer / technical marketing specifications.

A typical scenario might be to have multiple grades of material and multiple customer orders for different grades. The goal is to use as least as possible of a "premium" grade in the mix for a customer that does not willing to pay for this extra quality.

These grades can be defined across multiple assays. For example, in a coal industry it might be the `ash` left after burning the coal in certain conditions, or `moisture`. With this multiplicity the problem becomes more complex, since now we need to "nail" the order among multiple specs while reducing costs by using the least "precious" materials.
